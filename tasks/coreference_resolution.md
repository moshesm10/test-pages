# Coreference resolution

Coreference resolution is the task of clustering mentions in text that refer to the same underlying real world entities.

## RuEval-2019

Experiments are conducted on the data of the [CoNLL-2012 shared task](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W12-4501), which
uses OntoNotes coreference annotations. Papers
report the precision, recall, and F1 of the MUC, B3, and CEAFφ4 metrics using the official
CoNLL-2012 evaluation scripts. The main evaluation metric is the average F1 of the three metrics.
